Pretend it's 23:59:58 on December 31st. Happy New Year!

The past week and half has gone by like a blur. Winter holidays have this
reputation of never being long enough, and always being over as soon as they
start. In this case, they felt even shorter than usual because it was my first
time having a long and consecutive chunk of free time in Japan. My list of
things that I wanted to do and places that where I wanted to go was much longer
than what could conceivably fit in the amount of time and money at my
disposal. Last week I blogged about my trip to Hiroshima which replaced my
Christmas celebration. This week I want to talk about New Year in Japan, which I
did celebrate (sort of.)

First, you need to know that Japan is probably in second place as far as
countries that celebrate New Year the most. The New Year in Japan is a great
opportunity to have some (much needed) vacation, celebrate, and eat delicious
foods. Then comes the "first X" of the year, as well as the well known New
Year's resolution, a.k.a. the New Year Challenge as it is better known
here. Feel free to replace X by pretty much everything, although one X that
stands out a lot is the first sunrise. Japan being right after Australia in list
of countries where the sun first rises on a new day, the culture seems very
grateful about making it to see the dawn of a new year. Unfortunately, we could
not see it so well in Kobe because it was cloudy, but we had a nice broadcast of
the first sunrise in Tokyo, depicting a warm sun rising right behind Mount Fuji,
and it was quite moving.

Another tradition of Japan on New Year's Eve is to eat soba, a noodle similar to
spaghetti in thickness, but made of wheat and most often eaten in a soup or cold
with a side of sauce to dip it in, in a similar fashion to ramen or udon. Of
course, cooking is the most fun part of the ordeal, and my personal chef
prepared a mouth-watering supper for the both of us. To be fair, I cut up the
vegetables and washed the dishes, okay?

If this picture didn't make you want to eat soba, something must be wrong with you!

We then spent most of the evening switching between watching *Gaki no tsukai:
zettai waratte wa ikenai* and *Kouhaku*, both six hour long shows that lead up
to the New Year Countdown. Out of the two shows, most of you are probably
familiar with the former, but not the latter. If the title doesn't ring a bell,
you will probably nod in agreement or perhaps giggle a little when I remind you
of those guys sitting in a classroom that must listen to a chubby Japanese guy
count from 1 to 100 in terribly broken English, being severely punished with
sticks every time they laugh. *Kouhaku* means "Red & White" and is a less
intense show where a lot of famous artists gather and form two team of different
colors that you probably won't ever guess. The show includes in part
competitions where the audience and the people watching the show can vote for
either color, thus deciding a winner. The shows were both on Youtube very
briefly, and I had intended to link to playlists of each of them here, but
unfortunately they have already been removed for copyright infringement. Oh
well!

Eventually, we fell asleep despite the entertaining show and were woken up
around midnight when the small temple next door burst down into a really loud
and amazing Taiko performance. I have to admit that at first, I was thinking war
or something had started outside, slightly disoriented from the profound
sleep. Once the performance was over (it lasted about half an hour or so,) we
went back to sleep. I know. Very exciting!

The next morning, we woke up around 6:00AM, watched the sunrise on TV, and went
to what the Japanese call *Hatsumoude*, which is the first time at a shrine of
the year. We said a prayer, bought *Omikuji*, a Japanese fortune scroll that you
bind to a tree after reading in order to make the good happen, and the bad not
happen. We also ate *Tai-yaki*, a fish shaped cookie filled with *anko* paste.

Other than that, I am afraid that my new year was mostly a very calm one. On
another note, we have started looking for apartments and have found a good
candidate for an amazingly reasonable price. The only downside would be moving a
bit further away from downtown, but for me that is actually positive. The
apartment is near a park so I could potentially jog safely every day. Speaking
of jogging, I guess I should use this as an opportunity to write down my year
challenge and be accountable.

**2014 Challenge!**

- Jog 10K consistently
- Hit the gym at least 3 times a week for weight lifting as soon as possible*
- Finish the comment system for segfault.me
- Make (more) friends
- Continue eating healthy throughout the year
- Minimize beer consumption

As far as the gym is concerned, the only reason this is a challenge and not
already done is because it seems quite difficult to get a gym membership without
having some sort of identity in the country... a recurring problem I'm sure
you've gotten a good idea of if you've read everything until now!

What's your year challenge?

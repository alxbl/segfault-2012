I wake up at 5:00 feeling unusually alert and aware. Today is the beginning of a
very pleasant, yet very worriesome journey. I quickly pack my clothes, laptop
and other essentials as the clock ticks. My itinerary is a packed and hectic one
for the coming week. The deadline for the working permit is nearly over, so as a
precaution, I have decided to leave the country for a little bit before
ultimately coming back with a fresh visitor stay. My flight leaves at 12:10 from
Kansai airport, so I take the train at 5:30, headed for the bus terminal. Once I
arrive, it's a little past 6:00, and my bus leaves at 6:30. With a bit of time
on my hands, I find a convenience store from which to buy something to serve as
a breakfast. I eventually settle from an egg sandwich with a tuna riceball and a
bottle of tea.

After eating, I head to the bus stop, and hand over my luggage to the
driver. The bus ride to the airport goes without a hitch, and at approximately
8:00, I am sitting at the airport, waiting for the check-in counter to
open. 8:15 and I'm through check-in, and standing at a fairly short line through
security. Once through, it is a matter of waiting until my plane is ready for
boarding. Everything went well on that side, and the only thing worth mentioning
is that I was lucky enough to get an empty seat next to mine, so I could take up
much more space and be comfortable during the trip. Singapore Airlines also
provides with electrical outlets which is very handy for a seven hour flight.

At roughly 18:30 local time, we make our landing safely at the wonderful and
stylish Changi Airport. Besides a man that took forever in the queue to buy his
MRT pass (the local transit system,) nothing out of the ordinary happened. The
whole journey from the airport to Bugis station (the MRT station closest to my
hotel) tricks you into thinking Singapore's weather is not as harsh as everyone
says. An hour later, though, when alighting at Bugis and ascending the escalator
outside of the 18 degrees celcius climatised MRT, the heat wave hits you in the
face like a sack of bricks.

Indeed, Singapore is a country in which the seasons are at a complete
stand-still. Year around, the temperature is around 32 degress celcius, with
humidity reaching the 90% mark on a frequent basis. In exchange for the extreme
climate, its inhabitants are rewarded with clear blue skies, luscious green
tropical forests and wonderful sights. Native Singaporeans seldom know a
temperature below 20 celcius, and have no concept of snow or winter unless they
have travelled. It is a pretty refreshing experience, especially at the time
where Japan is still recovering from the winter frost.

Unfortunately, I do not have much else to say about Singapore, as it was a
rather uneventful business trip. Nonetheless, I was quite pleased to work from
an office with my coworkers again, and the social aspect of work was very
refreshing. Besides the culturally normal long hours of work, I did try to spend
as much time as I could hanging out with my coworkers and pick up some Singlish.

Despite the very busy schedule there, I did manage to squeeze out one day of my
schedule to go to the Jurong Bird Park. The bad part about the park was being
exposed to the sun for nearly five hours straight. The good part was seeing the
multitudes of exotic birds that simply do not exist in Canada. I took many
pictures, and will eventually have them available in a [public Singapore album
on Google+][album] for those who are interested.

identify. Below is a picture of Flamingos sparring with each other.

Of course, another aspect of the beautiful city is its food. On a recommendation
from a coworker, I decided to try a small restaurant called "The Banana Leaf
Apolo" in Singapore's little India. The experience was really amazing, with the
food being served straight on a banana tree leaf and consisting of a main dish
of rice with a multitude of toppings, sauces, and side dishes for mix-matching
and eating. This was by far my best eat out during my whole stay.

The last part I want to talk about is the returning trip to Japan, and the whole
reason for worrying. At the time of buying those tickets, I picked a direct
flight from Kansai Airport to Changi Airport, returning from Changi Airport to
Narita Airport. Now, Narita and Kobe are about 500km apart, and the reason I
picked the flight there are two-fold:

* I do not want immigration to have any reason to think I am focusing on Kansai
* There was a trade show which some of my coworkers were attending there, and it was possible for me to catch the last day

Thus, I was flying back into Japan without any proof of intent to leave, a few
days after leaving on the last day of my visitor visa. Suspicious enough, if you
are paying close attention to it. My only excuse was that I was here for
business "this time", and that I was going to a trade show, followed by
meetings.

Despite all the time I spent worrying, I was surprised to arrive at Narita and
go through immigration, where the guy politely says "Hi." to me, followed by an
quick glance over my immigration card, a nod, and asking me to take a
picture/prints. Then he looks at me and says "Thank you, welcome to Japan."

Inwardly, I breathe a sigh of relief. No questions, no remarks, nothing. He
stuck the immigration sticker and stapled the immigration card in my passport
and I was on my way to 3 more months of safety in Japan. The window of
opportunity for my visa now doubled, and there is ample space for the work
permit to be ready in time.

All in all, what was a trip full of unknowns and potential for bad luck actually
turned out to be a neat experience. I am hoping that this is the last time I
have to travel with the insecurity of whether or not I will be allowed back
home, for that is not an experience I would wish upon anyone!

Cheers!

At last, Golden Week came (and went by far too quickly!) Japan doesn't celebrate
Easter, so instead, we get two consecutive holidays on a Monday and Tuesday to
celebrate summer. The Japanese people call it GW for short, and during that time, The city seems to become incredibly alive and busier than usual.

People usually travel to South Korea, Taiwan, and other countries close to
Japan, and within Japan itself, along with many tourists coming in during the
summer holidays.

I enjoyed the long weekend and took the opportunity to play (too much) Diablo
III, as well as meet a few friends. Video games aside, the highlights of this
weekend include a visit to a fairly recent bar in Sannomiya called Public
Branch. One of my friends from Tokyo was coming over to Osaka, which is very
close by, so we took that opportunity to meet up again after almost exactly a
year.

I would later learn that he'd recommended that bar because, as it turns out, he
happens to be good friend with the owner, so that was pretty interesting. That
day I also had whale for the first time, which was actually not bad at all, not
that I would eat it every day, though. The owner of the bar was kind enough to
take this nice picture of all three of us.

Asides from that, I visited the Akashi castle park, which was refreshing and
fun. I was surprised to see what looked like three foreigners throwing a ball
around and having a good time. Again, I find myself wanting to go outdoors more
and explore the wilderness.

Next weekend, if the weather allows, I am planning to go to a very nice
mountain-side park near Suma and have my first picnic in 2014.

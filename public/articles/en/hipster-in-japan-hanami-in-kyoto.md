Friday this week, I took a day off to go and visit Kyoto in the season of
Hanami. The word itself literally means "Flower Seeing", and the flowers in
question are the very well known Sakura, or cherry blossoms. I am lucky that
Kobe itself is a little shy of an hour and a half by train from Kyoto, and so it
is actually feasible to go there for a single day of sight seeing.

My girlfriend lived in Kyoto for most of her University days, so sightseeing and
finding our way was not a problem. She took me to a national park in Kyoto where
there is an old over pass that lets the water from the great lake Biwako flow
through Kyoto to filtration stations. The sight itself is one to behold and has
inspired me to learn more about Japanese geography and history.

Our route then took us up large and worn out concrete blocks onto the reservoir
bridge itself. The road to cross the bridge had been blocked off, but towards
the mountain side, the road was open, sided by a sharp uphil slope on one side,
and a steep fall on the other. The walk itself was a bit muddy due to the
surrounding waters and I was very aware of the deadly fall less than a meter
away from me.

After walking along the waterway for a little while, we reached a clearing
housing what I would be inclined to call a water filtration plant. The plant
lead down to an old railway track that had once been used to lower boats into
the river at the base of the mountain.

We walked down the tracks and came across a replica of one of the train wagons
used to carry boats.

Walking past the replica, we eventually reached the river, and headed back
towards the town.

All in all, I would say the trip was a great success. My only qualm is that most
cherry blossoms were not yet blooming, as it is still a bit early for Hanami. I
am hoping to go back sometime in the middle of April for the full effect.

As usual, thank you for reading until now.

Time passes as I sit in the comfortable silence of my apartment. Occasionally,
the silence is broken by the sound of a train passing by, accompanied by the
crossing's monotonous bells warning pedestrians of the impending danger if they
were to decide to cross now. Within me, the continuous crescendo of unexpected
obstacles and the cacophony of renewed worries breaks loose and overwhelms me as
the ultimate deadline approaches.

I appear composed, I appear calm, I appear in control, but inside, things are
spinning furiously, scenarios are replaying in my mind, the what-ifs echo
endlessly off the walls of my soul. Just as quickly and suddenly as it began,
the noise fades out, the worries die down, and it's back to complete,
comfortable silence once again. I sip from a warm cup of tea and contemplate the
next few days to come.

Contrary to what I had initially expected, the levels of stress are unexpectedly
high. Forever looking foward to things winding down, continuously telling myself
that this is it, just a little more, you can make it, the light at the end of
the tunnel is nearly in sight, now is more stressful than ever.

February 27th. That's the date I'd been fearing ever since day zero. It's the
date where the world ends, the date where the guillotine falls. This
rollercoaster either comes to a full and safe stop, or it goes off rail into
something I dare not imagine.

Luckily for me, there might yet be an exit. A plan laid before me to leave and
re-enter the country in a legal, safe way. This knowledge is the only thing
keeping me composed right now.

Only a few days back, it was a completely different set of thoughts spinning
wildly within my head and keeping me awake with worry. The great day where I
left my tiny studio and moved into a nicer apartment. A nicer place to be.

Moving took me away from the mazes of people during peak hour, away from the
crowded malls, the heart of Kobe, and into a much calmer area, which, at the
same time, feels satisfyingly more like my image of country-side traditional
Japan. I am situated near a train track, and the noise of the trains passing by
at regular interval is the only (slight) downside to all of this.

For the first time in my life, I feel like I want to decorate this place like it
is mine. I am done with the temporary. I want to let my creativity out, and get
to some interior design. My first baby step is a dining table which doubles as a
desk until I actually decide on the desk and chair combo that I want for my work
station.

Getting used to the apartment is not difficult. Everything is so modern and so
convenient. I feel calm and safe here.

Moving itself wasn't the main reason of my worries though. Indeed, that day
marked an important milestone for me: The day where I met my in-laws for the
first time. Things went much better than expected, and I felt that we bonded
significantly over our first encounter. I am definitely looking forward to the
next meeting and further improving upon the impression I left upon them.

After a brief initiation to gas stove cooking, it was time to display my entire
30 minutes of expertise with the thing to prepare a memorable Valentine's day
supper for my beloved (without setting myself or the food on fire.) Things went
better than expected, and in the process I discovered cooking with wine can be
wonderful. The menu was a pumpkin cream, a slow cooked stew of red-wine
marinated beef and vanilla ice cream with strawberries. Of course, chocolate was
involved too. I would call it a fair success. Unfortunately, I also discovered
that slow cooking on a metered gas stove can get expensive, but that's a story
for another time.

My favorite way of coping with stress, which I assume is obvious by now if
you've been keeping up, remains food. Of course, that is until I can get that
gym membership I've been rambling about since the beginning of times.  Here you
can see subject A, a perfectly good bowl of udon with some tempura shrimp and
pumpkin. A delight.

Udon, while delicious, doesn't really cure a sweet tooth, so to remedy that, I
enjoy some delicious raspberry cheesecake (with a cup of coffee, of course!)

Despite the stress, there is always a positive side to be found in the worst of
situations. Lately I have been reminded of this multiple times through work and
through daily occurences. These are some words that I would love to live by, and
are a source of motivation to keep foraging ahead despite the rough times.

Next week will be busier than this week, but it will hopefully be the summit
before the return to normal. At least, with a renewed visa, I should feel less
pressure. Look forward to a blog about adventures in Kyoto and perhaps a
surprise destination.

As usual, thank you for reading so far, see you next time.

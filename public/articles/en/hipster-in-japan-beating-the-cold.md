I am alive!

A lot has happened since the last post, the most incapacitating of which being
what appears to have been a bad case of influenza, as is oft the case at this
time of the year. In order to celebrate my return to the world of the
productive, I wanted to write a light hearted recap of the past weeks in the
form of a picturesque culinary adventure.

First, nearly two weeks ago now, I do believe, we had a revisiting of the
excellent Yaoya store that had been our dining spot when I first landed in Japan
in late November. This time we went to a different instance of the store,
located in Motomachi, and tried some different dishes. As we exited the
elevator, we were greeted by the familiar antique and warm wooden décor that is
part of the franchise. Entering the store, we were seated near a window beyond
which lay crates, hay, and baskets of vegetables like onions and potatoes to
accent and distinguish the restaurant. A large group of businessmen were
enjoying what looked like a delicious hot pot while drinking, smoking and
talking loudly, but I only felt that it added to the convivial atmosphere.

We chose to eat an assortment of high-vegetables dishes for which I
unfortunately have no pictures, along with a special Onigiri that had piqued our
curiosity. It was called the "Explosion Onigiri", better known as the "Bakudan
Onigiri". After ordering it, we were wondering what was taking it so long to get
to us. As we were about to ask the waiter, though, he signaled us, all
knowingly, that he hadn't forgotten and that it was on its way. At that point,
we had not much idea what to expect, and then we were served this *thing*.

For lack of anything on-scale, this ball-of-deliciousness was approximately
twice the size of my fist and came with a splendid salad. And here we were
thinking of ending with something small.

Masterfully (not) hacking it open to peer at the insides yielded the following.

Now it is clear why they call it the explosion Onigiri. This shows Onions, Ham,
Peas, Salmon Eggs, Clovers, Avocados and other things that I cannot name.

All in all a delicious meal.

Later that week, we went to Kobe port for a walk. Lately we've both been too
busy and too tired to do anything extravagant on the weekends, so walks like
this are always welcome, as they provide a good opportunity to relax, enjoy the
outdoors, and take nice pictures. This one is of the famous harbor hotel in
Kobe, with a cloudy sky pierced by the sun, which I thought was quite
illustrative of the beautiful day it was taken on.

We've also been quite busy on the latte hunt and café crawl:

And visiting the famous Uotana fish market in Akashi inbetween rounds of work on
a busy weekend.

On top of all of these interesting adventures, I have been trying to come to
terms with a few things, the most important of which is my use of the
computer. I feel that lately I am spending too much time on the computer, and I
would like to get away from it. First, I feel like my time spent at the computer
outside of work hours is not used for productive things. I have more free time
than ever in my life, and my personal projects are not advancing faster, unlike
what I had expected of them. This is because most of the time I am too tired
from my actual work to work more on personal projects. Instead of forcing myself
to work on them and achieve nothing but frustration, I will be trying a new
method. I will not use the computer, and will instead focus on my other hobbies,
such as reading and cooking, which are two things I have been finding myself to
do more of lately. That being said, I will not turn down a pang of desire to
program when it shows up, and in this way, I am hoping to stimulate my brain
more when it comes to wanting to program personal projects.

As the temperature is warming up outside, I can feel the desire to go outside
grow within me as well. It might have something to do with just recently
recovering from my cold, but I also can't wait to go jogging some more.

Asides from that, I have been discovering the painful impacts of working with a
bed as a chair. I am currently putting up with some annoying back ache that I am
hoping a swift return to working out will fix, as well as a better posture once
I buy a table and a chair. The second monitor will be coming soon, I can feel
it, and I'm very psyched for it.

For the next article, I will be trying to approach the subject of working
remotely, since a few friends and colleagues have been asking me how it was
playing out for me. I would love to discuss the positive effects I have found it
brought, as well as the difficulties it brought me. After a little bit over two
months, it is starting to become clear that I will need to define a more
explicit way of managing it, but this is content for a later post.

Until next time!

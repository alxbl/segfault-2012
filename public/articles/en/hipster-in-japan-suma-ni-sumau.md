With almost a month since my last entry, I felt it was time to write
something. The truth is that I've been putting off writing for a little while
due to some technical issues with my blog. I accidentally pushed some unwanted
changes into the production pipeline, and had to roll those changes back. The
end result is that until I finish that feature, I can't reliable deploy, which
means it's annoying to write new content. Regardless, despite those issues, I
decided to just rollback the changes and continue writing my blog.

This weekend was very refreshing and relaxing. The temperature finally being
consistently over 20 degrees celcius and sunny was a nice energizing change from
the gray, cloudy and rainy spring weather. Today I felt like I could let go of
the pressure and stress of work for the first time in a long while.

Our day started off with a walk to Suma, the more commercial district next to
where I live right now. Once we got there, we went to a local bakery and bought
fresh bread for breakfast. Bread on its own is hardly breakfast, though, so we
made our way to the nearby Mister Donuts, a donuts/cafe type chain of stores in
Japan. In retrospect, I think Mister Donuts, often shortened to Misdo, is the
closest equivalent to a Tim Horton's in Canada.

There's something about a warm coffee, a donut and some bread in the morning for
breakfast. Despite it still being 9:30 in the morning, it was already nearing 23
celcius and walking out in the sun with a long shirt and pants was a bit too
warm for me. Walking home, we decided to take the beach trail and were
pleasantly surprised to see that many people were already out enjoying a nice
day.

While I couldn't catch pictures, it seemed that there was some sort of "clean up
the beaches of Suma" event going on, with many parents bringing their toddlers
to enjoy a day on the beach. It seemed interesting enough, but we had another
surprise coming up as we made our way home.

Indeed, we were met with many people enjoying the very clear weather, surfing
and lying down on the beach, building sand castles, or playing sports.

I've posted a very similar picture to this one before, but today was so clear
that we can readily see the Akashi-Awaji bridge on the picture. That bridge is
famous for being the longest suspended bridge in the world. It is quite a sight
to behold, if I must say so.

Next we reached Suma kaihin kouen, which is the park I usually go jogging
in. Today, however, it seemed that there was a fair going on, with lots of
different kiosks, some selling food, others drinks (who wouldn't want a cold
beer on a Sunday morning?), others selling souvenirs and apparently even live
fish. I wonder if they were fished from the sea on that very same day...

The fair also had live music, which wasn't like anything I'd ever heard
before. I can't really describe the sound, but it was an odd mix of ethnic and
traditional Japanese music. If anyone knows the name of the instruments they are
playing, I would be very interested to know. It seemed to me that it was a long
tube in which the guy made specific sounds (similar to beat boxing) in order to
get some melody going out of the reverb of his voice. Another guy was using a
stick to hit the ground in place of percussions, and the music was very
interesting.

The rest of the day, we spent watching a movie called "Blue is the warmest
color", a three hour long movie depicting the way a teenage girl copes with
growing up as a lesbian. We had to stop the movie midway through, but for the
curious, what I can say so far about it is that it wasn't an easy watch, and is
actually very heavy. Still, from a cinematographic point of view, it was a very
good movie.

Next weekend is the long-awaited golden week weekend, and hopefully I will have
more interesting things to blog about!

Thank you as always if you've read this far.

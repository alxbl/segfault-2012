In the spirit of reviving this blog a little bit, I want to talk about a short
trip that I took to Kyoto. The purpose of the trip was intially to meet my
girlfriend's friends and have a quick bite, as they had talked about meeting me
a few times now. We agreed to meet at Kyoto station at five in the afternoon, so
that gave us plenty of time to prepare.

After sleeping in a bit, cooking breakfast and generally getting ready for the
day, we took off and bought discount tickets with JR to go to Kyoto. The train
ride was a little shy of 45 minutes, and no transfers were required, unlike last
time. We got to Kyoto at around 11am, and came to the realization that we hadn't
planned anything until 5pm. Thus began a day of wandering around in the city and
trying to keep ourselves busy.

The first sight when coming out of the massive Kyoto station looked something
like this:

This is the top of the 10 story shopping complex that makes up the Kyoto
station. The middle of the tower is an open air stair case with a bunch of
escalators to make your way to the top. Quite an impressive sight.

Of course, we couldn't miss the Kyoto tower, which is right outside of the
station.

Fortunately, the day turned into a pleasant temple run where I got to enter
inside an actual temple for the first time since I came to Japan. It was funny
seeing clueless foreigners not being sure where to take off their shoes, and
more often than not just being completely obvious to the shoes-off sign and
simply stepping up the old wooden stairs with their dirty shoes on. No wonder
the staff is always sweeping the temple floor!

Inside the temple was very much like what one would expect from movies: A
central altar with golden statues and elements of the religion that I would not
be able to describe very well. The floor was traditional tatamis and the
atmosphere very serene and calming. Unfortunately, pictures of inside the temple
were not allowed, so this view of outside the temple will have to do.

On our way back from the temple, we saw some nice bushes with pink and white
flowers that adorned the waterway around the temple grounds.

Around 4pm, however, we were both starting to feel tired and exhausted from
spending the day walking around, and we realized that we had decided to come way
too early. We still managed to make it until our scheduled meeting with friends,
but decided to go without supper in favor of getting home early.

All in all, a very refreshing day. Here's the famous Touji pagoda as a departing
picture.

Title:    Hello World and Dreams Coming True

Ever since this site came online, I have been lacking a single thing. Content.
The backend itself has been (mostly) done for over a month now, with changeset
upon changeset of tweaks, minor improvements and other silly things. Now
however the time has come and I finally have something worthwile to post about.

First, though, a bit of background about this site and my general vision of it.

## Motivation

The short reason for this website coming into existence is quite simple:
`Ruby on Rails`.

In the past, I have done web development with multiple frameworks, including
PHP's Zend and Python's Django. I have however never stuck with these long
enough to get any meaningful website up and running. The reasons for this vary a
little, but it generally boiled down to either the language in use or minor
framework quirks that turned me off after a while.

I was eventually drawn to Ruby and decided to give rails a shot. It turned out
great and very enjoyable, and as such this website was born.

My intent with this site is two-fold,


1. Have my own, albeit somewhat modest, presence on the internet.
2. Document my journey in the world of software development.


This means people may or may not be interested by what I have to say or share,
but it will give me a place to point people to when they want to learn more
about me and what I do.

At the same time, it gives me a place where I can discuss issues and challenges
that I encounter while working on my personal projects, and host or display
the work that I do outside of the job. Yes, I know. I'm late to the personal
website party, but, as is oft said, better late than never.

## What to Expect

As this is a personal blog, expect to be subjected to my opinion of things, and
therefore to disagree once in a while. I am still in the process of planning out
the main points surrounding content, but you can expect to have a few series in
parallel at any given time, some technical, some mundane, and some ranting.

In no particular order, here is a list of topics I intend to discuss and blog
about:

- Software Development
- Software Debugging
- Software Architecture
- Project Management
- System Administration
- My Passion for Japanese

I hope some of these topics will keep you interested and reading if you are not
one of the people I've (perhaps) personally forced to follow my blog.

## Coming up Next

While I organize my thoughts about technical articles, I will keep a regular
blog schedule about one of my most important dreams and its realization, living
and working in Japan. The series, as recommended to me by a dear coworker, will
be titled *Hipster in Japan*. On that note. If you've read this far, thank you,
and I hope you'll find it in you to hit the RSS subscription button! I promise I
won't spam!

The site is still in its very early stages, and a lot of work still needs to be
done before I am satisfied with its quality. My current top priorities are
getting the **comment system** done and fully **localizing** the site (including
this content I'm producing) to Japanese. Once that is done, I will be able to
fully refocus on my other **projects** and producing **content**. All of that,
of course, while juggling full time work and real life.

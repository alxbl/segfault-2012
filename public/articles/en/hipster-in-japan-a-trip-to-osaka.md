Title:   Hipster in Japan #4: A Trip to Osaka

It's hard to believe it has already been nearly a month since I arrived. Time
flies by so quickly, it's both amazing to see the progress and scary to think
that if things keep going at this rate, it will be over before it even
started. Whenever I think too long about it, I start feeling apprehensive of
time and I find myself wishing things would just stand still. It might sound
silly, and despite understanding the need to focus on the present, the
underlying thought of this being temporary is always present.

I am starting to worry whether this thought is an affliction that is plaguing
me. Back in Montreal, each appartment I've lived at has been a temporary place
for me, and rightly so, I would tell myself that decorating, painting, and
interior design were all a waste of time relative to my eventual unavoidable
move. These feelings are back again now, regardless of my effort to enjoy myself
and my will to settle down.

In any case, I have steeled my resolve not to let these negative thoughts get
the best of me, and strive to enjoy day-to-day life as much as possible.

Today, I want to write about our trip to Osaka.

-----------------------------------------------

The masses of people at *Sannomiya* station is formidable and even
frightening. The core of Kobe, in the very middle of the beautiful Flower Road
(the "main" street,) is always busy and thriving with activity, in a hectic mix
of Japanese and tourists alike, young and old, hurried and leisurely, all going
about their daily business. As we head to the automated ticket selling machine
to buy our train tickets, I can catch whiffs of freshly baked bread and curry, a
smell that would make anyone hungry. The ticket to Nakatsu is 310 yen, an
acceptable price considering the distance.

The train is fairly crowded on a Saturday morning, and there is nowhere to
sit. We first take the special express train to the nearest station before
switching to the local line for the last two or three stations. In total, the
trip takes about half and hour, give or take ten minutes. My girlfriend has to
get a haircut, so our plan is for me to wait at a café and enjoy myself until
she is done and comes to pick me up.

Suffice to say that things hardly ever go to plan, and as things turn out, her
hair dresser booked the appointment on the wrong day. Instead of going at noon,
like we had planned, she ended up going around three in the afternoon. The net
result was nearly a whole day lost, and me reading approximately 30 pages of a
fairly difficult book called *こゝろ (Kokoro)* by Natsume Souseki. Without
getting into the details, the book is quite a fascinating read about life
lessons. The book was written in 1914 and uses fairly old Japanese and irregular
characters, so it is a slow progression for me.

After my third coffee, and as I was starting to worry about a haircut taking so
long, we finally caught up to each other and grabbed a quick dinner/lunch at a
delicious Korean restaurant.

Once the sun had set, we headed to our main reason for coming to Osaka: The
German Christmas Market. A nice amalgam of food stands, illuminations and
activities awaited us. The usual *Oktoberfest* beer and sausage stands were, of
course, present as well. I say usual because this is the third time I see
Oktoberfest in Japan in 2013. The Japanese people are well-known for their
appreciation of beer, and I think the fact that they have at least two instances
of Oktoberfest during the year, with recurring Oktoberfest themes during any
event that has a reference to Germany as a great example of this. It has now
somewhat become of a running joke that it is always Oktoberfest in Japan.

After admiring the light show and huge Christmas tree for a bit, we decided it
was time to make our way home.

-----------------------------

On a different note, being in Japan has brought upon me a realization that some
of my asian friends have insisted on pointing out, but that I hadn't believed
until experiencing it for myself: Canadians love coffee, and drink a lot of
coffee. This might seem mundane, but it means that relative to other countries,
we import so much more coffee, and thus driving the price of a quality cup of
coffee down by a significant amount when compared to Japan. It also seems that
Canadian barristas put a lot more care, passion and love into making you a good
latte. I'm thinking about one person in particular who makes the best lattes in
all of Montreal (Disclaimer: in my opinion.)

Like most Canadians, I am no exception, and so I have begun a quest to find the
best Café Latte in Japan. Of course, Japan is big, and when I say Japan, I mean
the general Kansai area...

... Kansai is a large chunk of Japan. Let's just say I am looking for the best
Latte in the Kobe area and restrict the number of samples.

In case this terrible joke made you cringe rather than laugh, I leave this
picture that was taken at a nice little Café in Motomachi. Thé Latte and Hot
Chocolate.

I know a hot chocolate does not qualify as a Latte, but I had a sudden craving
for chocolate, and this seemed like a good way to satisfy my brain and
stomach. The drink was a perfect blend of the bitterness of cocoa and just
enough milk and sugar to soothe it out to a level where it is easy to drink. All
in all, it left me very satisfied.

As usual, thank you for reading thus far, and as a reward for being a loyal
reader, here's [a link][pics] to many pictures that I haven't had the chance to
include in my blog articles so far. For the curious, you might want to bookmark
this album, as it will be updated whenever I have new pictures.

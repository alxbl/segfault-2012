I wipe away beads of sweat pearling on my forehead as I step onto the bus and
feel the cool breeze of air conditioning wash over me, making my way to the last
available seats in the back. Thomas, my coworker, and his girlfriend sit across
from me. The Malaysia customs bus finally got here after 30 minutes of waiting
outside in the brutal tropical sun and suffocating humidity.

Trtuh be told, we would have boarded the previous bus, but we missed it because
I had forgotten my passport at the hotel. It's not a common document to carry on
my person, as I am not usually in a situation where I can simply leave the
country for an evening and be back in the same day. Despite that small mishap,
the way to customs went without a hitch, once through, we crossed the No Man's
Land (A roughly 2km bridge that leads to the Malaysia immigration officers) and
went entered the country in a small city called Johor Baru. The customs
immediately opened up to a huge shopping complex, thus provided a perfect
occasion to shop for souvenirs. The following thirty minutes are mostly a blur
as we waited for Thomas' friend to come pick us up with his car.

My first thought as we departed the mall and headed to the highway towards the
outskirts of Johor Baru, was that Malaysia and Singapore were very similar, and
yet slightly different. Something about the unbearable heat, the jungle
surrounding us, and the bumpy roads jammed with cars, gave me the impression of
being in movie. The further we get from the city, the sparser high rise
buildings and houses become, until eventually all that is left is swamps,
jungle, and old decrepit houses with rusty roofs, collapsed walls, and broken
foundations. Whether or not people live in these houses is unclear to me, but I
would certainly not like to live in one of those.

The pleasant ride ends as we reach a small river-side campground where a young
boy, maybe 8, greets us in Malaysian, and guides our driver to park. I am
surprised to see the boy apparently ask for some money, until I learn that this
is in fact his job. I can tell right away that I'm not an usual sight for them,
as people are obviously talking about me, pointing and wondering what I'm doing
there. While not unsettling, I understand for the first time what it's like to
be in a country where you literally cannot communicate with others in any way. I
am grateful that my friends are there to help me out, and I resign to observant
silence.

We walk down a dirt trail bordered by aging shacks and stray dogs and make our
way to a dock-like area that is made up of old cracked wooden planks and
unstable looking pillars sinking into the river serving as the support for the
restaurant's furniture, kitchens, and the hundred or so of people dining there.
I carefully make my way along the small bridge and to an empty table. We sit
down and order a small feast among the four of us.

Pictured below are the squid rings with pinapples, a spinach-like vegetable of
which the name escapes me and one of the two seasoned whole crabs that we
ordered. We had an extra crab with different spices, as well as a big plate of
fish and vegetables. The food was definitely not a lacking point here.

After this small feast, we headed back into the city for a few game of darts at
a local pub. I did decently, went without a single victory.

The way back to Singapore was rather uneventful, and found all of us parting
ways after saying good night, eager to find the comfort of our respective beds.

Friday marked the first day of spring. In Japan, that day is called `Shunbun no
hi` and is a public holiday, which meant a long weekend here. I took the
occasion to enjoy a bit of the great outdoors as the day was especially hot. My
journey started with a leisurely walk on the beach near my apartment.

I am really looking forward to the summer, which will bring the beach to life
with swimmers, surfers, divers, joggers, and all the other people that want to
enjoy a sunny day near the ocean. It is the first time for me to live near the
sea, so I am quite excited about it. The scenery is something I have never seen
before in my life, and the feeling of an evening jog on the beach as the sun
sets is something straight out of a movie. It's amazing.

After a short pit stop home to have lunch, I met with my significant other to
run some errands in downtown Kobe. My apartment is slowly getting furnished and
starting to look good. In fact, my long awaited desk is due for arrival on April
1st, which will be a good improvement over working on the dining table.

We finally gave in and bought a TV tuner and remote controller combo in order to
have access to the Japanese digital broadcast system. The installation process
was extremely smooth and the end result is that we can watch TV on the laptop.
Neat! After a bit of consulting and pondering, we decided to settle for the
[Buffalo DH11/U2][tuner], which supports 16:10 HD, 4:3 and allows to record
video and perform time-shift. I do not really see myself using the recording
feature yet, but who knows, it might come in handy!

After our shopping spree, we decided to make a quick stop by the Kobe memorial
park, which is really vibrant with colors at this time of the year, and home to
a lot of group activities. There seems to be a group of foreigners that
regularly visits the park to play soccer. Seeing all the people in the park
enjoying themselves has made me consider buying some outdoor equipment to
satisfy my eagerness to play some sports. In the mean time, jogging will
suffice.

After a enjoying the sun for a bit, we decided to walk to Kobe through Meriken
Park, the Kobe harbor park which makes up the bulk of Kobe's touristic
attractions. Along the way, we took more pictures, of which are this rock which
looks a lot like a television screen:

As we neared the station, we encountered an unknown fruit-bearing tree. Puzzled
by its yellow and round fruits, we decided to investigate. The first picture is
that of the tree itself, which looks like any other tree:

The fruits were ripe and a lot of them had fallen off the branches, littering
the floor in similar fashion to the maple tree seeds in the Canadian Fall. I
picked up one of the seeds to fruther examine it, and after a little bit of
nothing interesting, decided it was time to go home.

Lastly, on a completely unrelated note, This month was my birthday, and I wanted
to say thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday. Here is a picture
of the cake I had to celebrate it. We bought it at a very famous bakery in
Osaka, and had to wait in line for nearly thirty minutes for a take out
order.

It was definitely worth the wait, and I could've easily eaten the whole
cake as opposed to only one slice. Restrictiong myself to one slice was
definitely benefical to my wasteline, though!

As usual, thank you for reading, and until next time.

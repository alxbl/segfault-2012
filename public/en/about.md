Hi! My name is Alexandre Beaulieu. I'm a C++ developer born in Trois-Rivi√®res
in March 1990. I have always been very curious and passionate about computers.

Ever since the day where my parents got their first computer, I have been
tinkering, playing and learning how these wonderful machines work. I would be
lying if I said I was only interested by programming. What I love the most
is discovering new technologies and thinking about how to solve the problems
I face in my day to day use of computers.

I've laid my hands on a wide range of topics, from web design to compilers
and static analysis. In particular, I enjoy diving into the nitty gritty bits
of computers systems. This makes fields like Networking, Compilers, and
Distributed Computing some of the topics that fascinate me the most.

Besides being a computer geek, I have a very fond attachment to Japanese
culture and the Japanese language. I am studying in an attempt to become a
fluent speaker of Japanese. My ultimate dream is being a software developer
while living in Japan.

Whenever I'm not busy programming or studying Japanese, I like to go for a
jog or hit the gym to get rid of the stress from the day-to-day life.

If you'd like to know more about me, or if you'd like to go for a jog,
feel free to drop me a line by e-mail.
